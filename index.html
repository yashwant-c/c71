                <p class="text-left text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", wihich you must attend if possible.</p>

Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="amazon-forest.jpg">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> The World Bank Board of Directors approved today the US$200 million First Amazonas Fiscal and Environmental Sustainability Programmatic DPF.
                The project will support fiscal reforms aimed at promoting fiscal sustainability while integrating forest conservation and development, as part of the state’s post-COVID-19 economic recovery plan. The project will also promote social inclusion by increasing the number of vulnerable families covered by the Bolsa Forest Program from 9,600 to 12,000.
                Since the first case of the novel coronavirus was registered in Brazil this past February, the state of Amazonas has been severely affected by the pandemic, recording more than 4,500 deaths. It is currently the state with the fourth highest rate of deaths due to the disease. The economic shock was also large, with the World Bank estimating a drop of 5.6 percent in state gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, with widespread implications for employment, poverty, and inequality.
                “We adopted fiscal adjustment measures to restore and safeguard fiscal sustainability in the short and medium term. The COVID-19 economic shock has put an extra weight on the state’s economy. But we are very positive that this program will allow us to move forward with the necessary reforms to create fiscal space to leverage transfers to municipalities and improve environmental service delivery,” said Wilson Miranda Lima, Governor of the Amazonas State.
